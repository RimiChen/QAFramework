1 ` What is it ? '
2 answered he .
3 ` The ogre is coming after us .
4 I saw him . '
5 ` But where is he ?
6 I do n't see him . '
7 ` Over there .
8 He only looks about as tall as a needle . '
9 Then they both began to run as fast as they could , while the ogre and his dog kept drawing always nearer .
10 A few more steps , and he would have been by their side , when Dschemila threw the darning needle behind her .
11 In a moment it became an iron mountain between them and their enemy .
12 ` We will break it down , my dog and I , ' cried the ogre in a rage , and they dashed at the mountain till they had forced a path through , and came ever nearer and nearer .
13 ` Cousin ! '
14 said Dschemila suddenly .
15 ` What is it ? '
16 ` The ogre is coming after us with his dog . '
17 ` You go on in front then , ' answered he ; and they both ran on as fast as they could , while the ogre and the dog drew always nearer and nearer .
18 ` They are close upon us ! '
19 cried the maiden , glancing behind , ` you must throw the pin . '
20 So Dschemil took the pin from his cloak and threw it behind him , and a dense thicket of thorns sprang up round them , which the ogre and his dog could not pass through . '
21 I will get through it somehow , if I burrow underground , ' cried he , and very soon he and the XXXXX were on the other side .	dog		Cousin|cloak|dog|maiden|mountain|needle|path|pin|side|steps

1 Then they said to the little girl : ` Climb this tree , dear Letiko , and remain there till we have finished eating . '
2 So Letiko climbed the tree , and the hares went grazing .
3 It was not very long , however , before a lamia came under the tree and called out : ` Letiko , Letiko , come down and see what beautiful shoes I have on . '
4 ` Oh !
5 my shoes are much finer than yours . '
6 ` Come down .
7 I am in a hurry , for my house is not yet swept . '
8 ` Go home and sweep it then , and come back when you are ready . '
9 Then the lamia went away and swept her house , and when she was ready she came back and called out : ` Letiko , Letiko , come down and see what a beautiful apron I have . '
10 -LSB- Illustration : LETIKO , LETIKO , COME DOWN AND SEE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL APRON I HAVE -RSB- ` Oh !
11 my apron is much finer than yours . '
12 ` If you will not come down I will cut down the tree and eat you . '
13 ` Do so , and then eat me . '
14 Then the lamia hewed with all her strength at the tree , but could not cut it down .
15 And when she saw that , she called out : ` Letiko , Letiko , come down , for I must feed my children . '
16 ` Go home then and feed them , and come back when you are ready . '
17 When the lamia was gone away , Letiko called out : ` Little hares !
18 little hares ! '
19 Then said one hare to the other : ` Listen , Letiko is calling ; ' and they both ran back to her as fast as they could go .
20 Then Letiko came down from the tree , and they went on their way .
21 The lamia ran as fast as she could after them , to catch them up , and when she came to a field where people were working she asked them : ` Have you seen any one pass this XXXXX ? '	way		Illustration|children|eating|grazing|hare|home|house|strength|sweep|way

1 After supper Mohammed said to the owner of the tent , ` Your ram will kill my greyhound . '
2 ` Oh , no , he wo n't . '
3 ` And supposing he does ? '
4 ` Then you can take him in exchange . '
5 So in the night Mohammed killed the greyhound , and laid his body across the horns of the ram .
6 Then he set up shrieks and yells , till he roused the Arab , who said ` Take the ram and go away . '
7 Mohammed did not need to be told twice , and at sunset he reached another Bedouin encampment .
8 He was received kindly , as usual , and after supper he said to his host : ` Your daughter will kill my ram . '
9 ` Be silent , she will do nothing of the sort ; my daughter does not need to steal meat , she has some every day . '
10 ` Very well , I will go to sleep ; but if anything happens to my ram I will call out . '
11 ` If my daughter touches anything belonging to my guest I will kill her , ' said the Arab , and went to his bed .
12 When everybody was asleep , Mohammed got up , killed the ram , and took out his liver , which he broiled on the fire .
13 He placed a piece of it in the girl 's hands , and laid some more on her night-dress while she slept and knew nothing about it .
14 After this he began to cry out loudly .
15 ` What is the matter ?
16 be silent at once ! '
17 called the Arab .
18 ` How can I be silent , when my ram , which I loved like a child , has been slain by your daughter ? '
19 ` But my daughter is asleep , ' said the Arab .
20 ` Well , go and see if she has not some of the flesh about her . '
21 ` If she has , you may take her in XXXXX for the ram ; ' and as they found the flesh exactly as Mohammed had foretold , the Arab gave his daughter a good beating , and then told her to get out of sight , for she was now the property of this stranger .	exchange		daughter|everybody|exchange|greyhound|hands|matter|owner|ram|sunset|tent

1 It had great claws as big as ice tongs , and it roared like a lion .
2 In his dream Farmer Brown 's boy was running with all his might .
3 Then he tripped and fell , and somehow he could n't get up again .
4 The terrible monster came nearer and nearer .
5 Farmer Brown 's boy tried to scream and could n't .
6 He was so frightened that he had lost his voice .
7 The terrible monster was right over him now and reached out one of his huge paws with the great claws .
8 One of them touched him on the cheek , and it burned like fire .
9 With a yell , a real , genuine yell , Farmer Brown 's boy awoke and sprang out of bed .
10 For a minute he could n't think where he was .
11 Then with a sigh of relief he realized that he was safe in his own snug little room with the first Jolly Little Sunbeam creeping in at the window to wish him good morning and chide him for being such a lazy fellow .
12 A thump and a scurry of little feet caught his attention , and he turned to see a Gray Squirrel running for the open window .
13 It jumped up on the sill , looked out , then jumped down inside again , and ran over to a corner of the room , where he crouched as if in great fear .
14 It was clear that he had been badly frightened by the yell of Farmer Brown 's boy , and that he was still more frightened by something he had seen when he looked out of the window .
15 A great light broke over Farmer Brown 's boy .
16 `` Happy Jack , you little rascal , I believe you are the terrible monster that scared me so ! ''
17 he exclaimed .
18 `` I believe you were on my bed , and that it was your claws that I felt on my face .
19 But what ails you ?
20 You look frightened almost to death . ''
21 He went over to the XXXXX and looked out .	window		bed|boy|cheek|claws|face|might|monster|paws|thump|window

1 No , it looked like the shadow of Johnny Chuck .
2 Peter rubbed his eyes and looked again .
3 Then he hurried as fast as he could , lipperty-lipperty - lip .
4 The nearer he got , the less like Johnny Chuck looked the one sitting on Johnny Chuck 's door-step .
5 Johnny Chuck had gone to sleep round and fat and roly-poly , so fat he could hardly waddle .
6 This fellow was thin , even thinner than Peter Rabbit himself .
7 He waved a thin hand to Peter .
8 `` Hello , Peter Rabbit !
9 I told you that I would see you in the spring .
10 How did you stand the long winter ? ''
11 That certainly was Johnny Chuck 's voice .
12 Peter was so delighted that in his hurry he fell over his own feet .
13 `` Is it really and truly you , Johnny Chuck ? ''
14 he cried .
15 `` Of course it 's me ; who did you think it was ? ''
16 replied Johnny Chuck rather crossly , for Peter was staring at him as if he had never seen him before .
17 `` I -- I -- I did n't know , '' confessed Peter Rabbit .
18 `` I thought it was you and I thought it was n't you .
19 What have you been doing to yourself , Johnny Chuck ?
20 Your coat looks three sizes too big for you , and when I last saw you it did n't look big enough . ''
21 Peter hopped all around Johnny Chuck , looking at him as if he did n't believe his own XXXXX .	eyes		course|eyes|fat|feet|fellow|hand|sizes|spring|voice|winter

1 Send me your portrait by this faithful messenger .
2 If I return it to you , you must give up hope ; but if I keep it you will know that to help me will be to help yourself .
3 -- Graziella . '
4 Before flying back the pigeon remembered about the flower , so , seeing one in the princess 's dress , he stole it and flew away .
5 The prince was wild with joy at the pigeon 's return with the note .
6 After an hour 's rest the trusty little bird was sent back again , carrying a miniature of the prince , which by good luck he had with him .
7 On reaching the tower the pigeon found the princess in the garden .
8 She hastened to untie the ribbon , and on opening the miniature case what was her surprise and delight to find it very like the picture her governess had painted for her .
9 She hastened to send the pigeon back , and you can fancy the prince 's joy when he found she had kept his portrait .
10 ` Now , ' said the fairy , ` let us lose no more time .
11 I can only make you happy by changing you into a bird , but I will take care to give you back your proper shape at the right time . '
12 The prince was eager to start , so the fairy , touching him with her wand , turned him into the loveliest humming-bird you ever saw , at the same time letting him keep the power of speech .
13 The pigeon was told to show him the way .
14 Graziella was much surprised to see a perfectly strange bird , and still more so when it flew to her saying , ` Good-morning , sweet princess . '
15 She was delighted with the pretty creature , and let him perch on her finger , when he said , ` Kiss , kiss , little birdie , ' which she gladly did , petting and stroking him at the same time .
16 After a time the princess , who had been up very early , grew tired , and as the sun was hot she went to lie down on a mossy bank in the shade of the arbour .
17 She held the pretty bird near her breast , and was just falling asleep , when the fairy contrived to restore the prince to his own shape , so that as Graziella opened her eyes she found herself in the arms of a lover whom she loved in return !
18 At the same moment her enchantment came to an end .
19 The tower began to rock and to split .
20 Bonnetta hurried up to the top so that she might at least perish with her dear princess .
21 Just as she reached the XXXXX , the kind fairy who had helped the prince arrived with the fairy Placida , in a car of Venetian glass drawn by six eagles .	garden		bank|case|delight|eyes|garden|kiss|luck|miniature|return|sun

1 And the star answered : ' I have been shining all night , and I have not seen him . '
2 But the star gave her a pair of shoes , and told her that if she put them on she would be able to walk two hundred miles at a stride .
3 So she drew them on , and she walked to the moon , and she said : ` Dear moon , have you not seen the white wolf ? '
4 But the moon answered , ` All night long I have been sailing through the heavens , and I have only just come home ; but I did not see him . '
5 But he gave her a pair of shoes , in which she would be able to cover four hundred miles with every stride .
6 So she went to the sun , and said : ` Dear sun , have you seen the white wolf ? '
7 And the sun answered , ` Yes , I have seen him , and he has chosen another bride , for he thought you had left him , and would never return , and he is preparing for the wedding .
8 But I will help you .
9 Here are a pair of shoes .
10 If you put these on you will be able to walk on glass or ice , and to climb the steepest places .
11 And here is a spinning-wheel , with which you will be able to spin moss into silk .
12 When you leave me you will reach a glass mountain .
13 Put on the shoes that I have given you and with them you will be able to climb it quite easily .
14 At the summit you will find the palace of the white wolf . '
15 Then the princess set out , and before long she reached the glass mountain , and at the summit she found the white wolf 's palace , as the sun had said .
16 But no one recognised her , as she had disguised herself as an old woman , and had wound a shawl round her head .
17 Great preparations were going on in the palace for the wedding , which was to take place next day .
18 Then the princess , still disguised as an old woman , took out her spinning-wheel , and began to spin moss into silk .
19 And as she spun the new bride passed by , and seeing the moss turn into silk , she said to the old woman : ` Little mother , I wish you would give me that spinning-wheel . '
20 -LSB- Illustration : The Bride wishes to buy the Spinning-Wheel -RSB- And the princess answered , ' I will give it to you if you will allow me to sleep to-night on the mat outside the prince 's door . '
21 And the XXXXX replied , ` Yes , you may sleep on the mat outside the door . '	bride		bride|door|heavens|mat|palace|place|places|summit|sun|wedding

1 Happy Jack .
2 Striped Chipmunk jumped out of bed very early Thanksgiving morning .
3 It was going to be a very busy day .
4 He had invited Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel , and Chatterer the Red Squirrel , to eat Thanksgiving dinner with him , and each had promised to be there .
5 Striped Chipmunk chuckled as he thought how neither of his guests knew that the other was to be there .
6 He washed his face and hands , brushed his hair , and ate his breakfast .
7 Then he scurried over to his splendid new storehouse , which no one knew of but himself , and stuffed the pockets in his cheeks with good things to eat .
8 When he could n't stuff another thing in , he scurried over to the nice , mossy log on the edge of the Green Forest , and there he emptied his pockets , for that was to be his dining table .
9 Back and forth , back and forth between his secret storehouse and the smooth , mossy log hurried Striped Chipmunk .
10 He knew that Happy Jack and the Chatterer have great appetites , and he wanted to be sure that there was plenty of good things to eat .
11 And as he scurried along , he sang a little song .
12 `` Thanksgiving comes but once a year , But when it comes it brings good cheer .
13 For in my storehouse on this day Are piles of good things hid away .
14 Each day I 've worked from early morn To gather acorns , nuts , and corn , Till now I 've plenty and to spare Without a worry or a care .
15 So light of heart the whole day long , I 'll sing a glad Thanksgiving song . ''
16 Promptly at the dinner hour Happy Jack appeared coming from one direction , and Chatterer the Red Squirrel coming from another direction .
17 They did n't see each other until just as they reached Striped Chipmunk 's smooth , mossy log .
18 Then they stopped and scowled .
19 Striped Chipmunk pretended not to notice anything wrong and bustled about , talking all the time as if his guests were the best of friends .
20 On the smooth , mossy log was a great pile of shining yellow corn .
21 There was another XXXXX of plump ripe acorns , and three little piles of dainty looking brown seeds .	pile		Jack|acorns|care|edge|log|one|pile|plenty|pockets|worry

1 And he dipped it into the well , and the water stayed in it .
2 Then the girl returned to the house , carrying the basket filled with water .
3 When the witch saw it , she became white with rage , and exclaimed ` Bensiabel must have helped you . '
4 And Prunella looked down , and said nothing .
5 ` Well , we shall see who will win in the end , ' said the witch , in a great rage .
6 The following day she called the girl to her and said : ` Take this sack of wheat .
7 I am going out for a little ; by the time I return I shall expect you to have made it into bread .
8 If you have not done it I will kill you . '
9 Having said this she left the room , closing and locking the door behind her .
10 Poor Prunella did not know what to do .
11 It was impossible for her to grind the wheat , prepare the dough , and bake the bread , all in the short time that the witch would be away .
12 At first she set to work bravely , but when she saw how hopeless her task was , she threw herself on a chair , and began to weep bitterly .
13 She was roused from her despair by hearing Bensiabel 's voice at her side saying : ` Prunella , Prunella , do not weep like that .
14 If you will give me a kiss I will make the bread , and you will be saved . ' '
15 I will not kiss the son of a witch , ' replied Prunella .
16 But Bensiabel took the wheat from her , and ground it , and made the dough , and when the witch returned the bread was ready baked in the oven .
17 Turning to the girl , with fury in her voice , she said : ` Bensiabel must have been here and helped you ; ' and Prunella looked down , and said nothing .
18 ` We shall see who will win in the end , ' said the witch , and her eyes blazed with anger .
19 Next day she called the girl to her and said : ` Go to my sister , who lives across the mountains .
20 She will give you a casket , which you must bring back to me . '
21 This she said knowing that her sister , who was a still more cruel and wicked XXXXX than herself , would never allow the girl to return , but would imprison her and starve her to death .	witch		closing|door|dough|ground|house|room|son|time|water|witch

1 ` Oh , do not speak to me of marrying , ' sobbed the king ; ` rather let me die with you ! '
2 But the queen only smiled faintly , and turned over on her pillow and died .
3 For some months the king 's grief was great ; then gradually he began to forget a little , and , besides , his counsellors were always urging him to seek another wife .
4 At first he refused to listen to them , but by-and-by he allowed himself to be persuaded to think of it , only stipulating that the bride should be more beautiful and attractive than the late queen , according to the promise he had made her .
5 Overjoyed at having obtained what they wanted , the counsellors sent envoys far and wide to get portraits of all the most famous beauties of every country .
6 The artists were very busy and did their best , but , alas !
7 nobody could even pretend that any of the ladies could compare for a moment with the late queen .
8 At length , one day , when he had turned away discouraged from a fresh collection of pictures , the king 's eyes fell on his adopted daughter , who had lived in the palace since she was a baby , and he saw that , if a woman existed on the whole earth more lovely than the queen , this was she !
9 He at once made known what his wishes were , but the young girl , who was not at all ambitious , and had not the faintest desire to marry him , was filled with dismay , and begged for time to think about it .
10 That night , when everyone was asleep , she started in a little car drawn by a big sheep , and went to consult her fairy godmother . '
11 I know what you have come to tell me , ' said the fairy , when the maiden stepped out of the car ; ` and if you do n't wish to marry him , I will show you how to avoid it .
12 Ask him to give you a dress that exactly matches the sky .
13 It will be impossible for him to get one , so you will be quite safe . '
14 The girl thanked the fairy and returned home again .
15 -LSB- Illustration : The King 's Pet Donkey -RSB- The next morning , when her father -LRB- as she had always called him -RRB- came to see her , she told him that she could give him no answer until he had presented her with a dress the colour of the sky .
16 The king , overjoyed at this answer , sent for all the choicest weavers and dressmakers in the kingdom , and commanded them to make a robe the colour of the sky without an instant 's delay , or he would cut off their heads at once .
17 Dreadfully frightened at this threat , they all began to dye and cut and sew , and in two days they brought back the dress , which looked as if it had been cut straight out of the heavens !
18 The poor girl was thunderstruck , and did not know what to do ; so in the night she harnessed her sheep again , and went in search of her godmother .
19 ` The king is cleverer than I thought , ' said the fairy ; ` but tell him you must have a dress of moonbeams . '
20 And the next day , when the king summoned her into his presence , the girl told him what she wanted .
21 ` Madam , I can refuse you nothing , ' said he ; and he ordered the XXXXX to be ready in twenty-four hours , or every man should be hanged .	dress		bride|country|delay|dress|heads|maiden|moment|presence|time|wife

1 In this manner a whole year soon slipped away , and Fortunatus was so busy amusing himself that he never once remembered his parents whom he had left behind in Cyprus .
2 But though he was thoughtless , he was not bad-hearted .
3 As soon as their existence crossed his mind , he set about making preparations to visit them , and as he was not fond of being alone he looked round for some one older and wiser than himself to travel with him .
4 It was not long before he had the good luck to come across an old man who had left his wife and children in a far country many years before , when he went out into the world to seek the fortune which he never found .
5 He agreed to accompany Fortunatus back to Cyprus , but only on condition he should first be allowed to return for a few weeks to his own home before venturing to set sail for an island so strange and distant .
6 Fortunatus agreed to his proposal , and as he was always fond of anything new , said that he would go with him .
7 The journey was long , and they had to cross many large rivers , and climb over high mountains , and find their way through thick woods , before they reached at length the old man 's castle .
8 His wife and children had almost given up hopes of seeing him again , and crowded eagerly round him .
9 Indeed , it did not take Fortunatus five minutes to fall in love with the youngest daughter , the most beautiful creature in the whole world , whose name was Cassandra .
10 ` Give her to me for my wife , ' he said to the old man , ` and let us all go together to Famagosta . '
11 So a ship was bought big enough to hold Fortunatus , the old man and his wife , and their ten children -- five of them sons and five daughters .
12 And the day before they sailed the wedding was celebrated with magnificent rejoicings , and everybody thought that Fortunatus must certainly be a prince in disguise .
13 But when they reached Cyprus , he learned to his sorrow that both his father and mother were dead , and for some time he shut himself up in his house and would see nobody , full of shame at having forgotten them all these years .
14 Then he begged that the old man and his wife would remain with him , and take the place of his parents .
15 For twelve years Fortunatus and Cassandra and their two little boys lived happily in Famagosta .
16 They had a beautiful house and everything they could possibly want , and when Cassandra 's sisters married the purse provided them each with a fortune .
17 But at last Fortunatus grew tired of staying at home , and thought he should like to go out and see the world again .
18 Cassandra shed many tears at first when he told her of his wishes , and he had a great deal of trouble to persuade her to give her consent .
19 But on his promising to return at the end of two years she agreed to let him go .
20 Before he went away he showed her three chests of gold , which stood in a room with an iron door , and walls twelve feet thick .
21 ` If XXXXX should happen to me , ' he said , ` and I should never come back , keep one of the chests for yourself , and give the others to our two sons . '	anything		anything|condition|creature|hopes|house|length|man|mountains|nobody|parents

1 When our grown-ups returned almost the first words Aunt Janet said were , `` And so you had the Governor 's wife to tea ? ''
2 We all stared at her .
3 `` I do n't know what you mean , '' said Felicity .
4 `` We had nobody to tea except Great-aunt Eliza .
5 She came this afternoon and -- '' `` Great-aunt Eliza ?
6 Nonsense , '' said Aunt Janet .
7 `` Aunt Eliza was in town today .
8 She had tea with us at Aunt Louisa 's .
9 But was n't Mrs. Governor Lesley here ?
10 We met her on her way back to Charlottetown and she told us she was .
11 She said she was visiting a friend in Carlisle and thought she 'd call to see father for old acquaintance sake .
12 What in the world are all you children staring like that for ?
13 Your eyes are like saucers . ''
14 `` There was a lady here to tea , '' said Felicity miserably , `` but we thought it was Great-aunt Eliza -- she never SAID she was n't -- I thought she acted queer -- and we all yelled at her as if she was deaf -- and said things to each other about her nose -- and Pat running over her clothes -- '' `` She must have heard all you said while I was showing her the photographs , Dan , '' cried Cecily .
15 `` And about the Governor at tea time , '' chuckled unrepentant Dan .
16 `` I want to know what all this means , '' said Aunt Janet sternly .
17 She knew in due time , after she had pieced the story together from our disjointed accounts .
18 She was horrified , and Uncle Alec was mildly disturbed , but Uncle Roger roared with laughter and Aunt Olivia echoed it .
19 `` To think you should have so little sense ! ''
20 said Aunt Janet in a disgusted tone .
21 `` I think it was real mean of her to pretend she was deaf , '' said XXXXX , almost on the verge of tears .	Felicity		Felicity|Nonsense|Uncle|father|friend|story|tea|things|time|tone

1 So Prunella , having listened carefully to his instructions , did just what he had told her .
2 She reached the house , oiled the hinges of the door , threw the loaf to the dog , gave the poor woman at the well the rope , and the woman in the kitchen the broom , caught up the casket from the top of the cupboard , and fled with it out of the house .
3 But the witch heard her as she ran away , and rushing to the window called out to the woman in the kitchen : ` Kill that thief , I tell you ! '
4 But the woman replied : ' I will not kill her , for she has given me a broom , whereas you forced me to clean the hearth with my tongue . '
5 Then the witch called out in fury to the woman at the well ; ` Take the girl , I tell you , and fling her into the water , and drown her ! '
6 But the woman answered ; ` No , I will not drown her , for she gave me this rope , whereas you forced me to use my hair to let down the bucket to draw water . '
7 Then the witch shouted to the dog to seize the girl and hold her fast ; but the dog answered ; ` No , I will not seize her , for she gave me a loaf of bread , whereas you let me starve with hunger . '
8 The witch was so angry that she nearly choked , as she called out ; ` Door , bang upon her , and keep her a prisoner . '
9 But the door answered ; ' I wo n't , for she has oiled my hinges , so that they move quite easily , whereas you left them all rough and rusty . '
10 And so Prunella escaped , and , with the casket under her arm , reached the house of her mistress who , as you may believe , was as angry as she was surprised to see the girl standing before her , looking more beautiful than ever .
11 Her eyes flashed , as in furious tones she asked her , ` Did you meet Bensiabel ? '
12 But Prunella looked down , and said nothing .
13 ` We shall see , ' said the witch , ` who will win in the end .
14 Listen , there are three cocks in the hen-house ; one is yellow , one black , and the third is white .
15 If one of them crows during the night you must tell me which one it is .
16 Woe to you if you make a mistake .
17 I will gobble you up in one mouthful . '
18 Now Bensiabel was in the room next to the one where Prunella slept .
19 At midnight she awoke hearing a cock crow .
20 ` Which one was that ? '
21 shouted the XXXXX .	witch		arm|cupboard|hinges|house|kitchen|mistress|prisoner|room|well|witch

1 Dschemila ! '
2 cried they ; but nobody answered .
3 ` If we make a fire , perhaps she will see it , ' said one of the men .
4 And they lit a fire , and then went , one this way , and one that , through the forest , to look for her , whispering to each other that if she had been killed by a lion they would be sure to find some trace of it ; or if she had fallen asleep , the sound of their voices would wake her ; or if a snake had bitten her , they would at least come on her corpse .
5 All night they searched , and when morning broke and they knew no more than before what had become of the maiden , they grew weary , and said to the mother : ` It is no use .
6 Let us go home , nothing has happened to your daughter , except that she has run away with a man . '
7 ` Yes , I will come , ' answered she , ` but I must first look in the river .
8 Perhaps some one has thrown her in there . '
9 But the maiden was not in the river .
10 For four days the father and mother waited and watched for their child to come back ; then they gave up hope , and said to each other : ` What is to be done ?
11 What are we to say to the man to whom Dschemila is betrothed ?
12 Let us kill a goat , and bury its head in the grave , and when the man returns we must tell him Dschemila is dead . '
13 Very soon the bridegroom came back , bringing with him carpets and soft cushions for the house of his bride .
14 And as he entered the town Dschemila 's father met him , saying , ` Greeting to you .
15 She is dead . '
16 At these words the young man broke into loud cries , and it was some time before he could speak .
17 Then he turned to one of the crowd who had gathered round him , and asked : ` Where have they buried her ? '
18 ` Come to the churchyard with me , ' answered he ; and the young man went with him , carrying with him some of the beautiful things he had brought .
19 These he laid on the grass and then began to weep afresh .
20 All day he stayed , and at nightfall he gathered up his stuffs and carried them to his own house .
21 But when the day dawned he took them in his arms and returned to the XXXXX , where he remained as long as it was light , playing softly on his flute .	grave		corpse|goat|grave|hope|lion|nobody|nothing|use|way|weep

1 And the prince continued : ' I am tired to death .
2 Order some soup to be made for me , but I do n't want that bear to meddle with it .
3 Every time I speak of my love the brute mutters and laughs , and seems to mock at me .
4 I hate the sight of the creature ! '
5 When the soup was ready , the bear brought it to the prince ; but before handing it to him , she dropped into the plate the ring the prince had given her the night before at the ball .
6 The prince began to eat his soup very slowly and languidly , for he was sad at heart , and all his thoughts were busy , wondering how and where he could see the lovely stranger again .
7 Suddenly he noticed the ring at the bottom of the plate .
8 In a moment he recognised it , and was dumb with surprise .
9 Then he saw the bear standing beside him , looking at him with gentle , beseeching eyes , and something in the eyes of the bear made him say : ` Take off that skin , some mystery is hidden beneath it . '
10 And the bear 's skin dropped off , and the beautiful girl stood before him , in the dress woven out of the starlight , and he saw that she was the stranger with whom he had fallen so deeply in love .
11 And now she appeared to him a thousand times more beautiful than ever , and he led her to his mother .
12 And the princess told them her story , and how she had been kept shut up by her father in his palace , and how she had wearied of her imprisonment .
13 And the prince 's mother loved her , and rejoiced that her son should have so good and beautiful a wife .
14 So they were married , and lived happily for many years , and reigned wisely over their kingdom .
15 THE SUNCHILD Once there was a woman who had no children , and this made her very unhappy .
16 So she spoke one day to the Sunball , saying : ` Dear Sunball , send me only a little girl now , and when she is twelve years old you may take her back again . '
17 So soon after this the Sunball sent her a little girl , whom the woman called Letiko , and watched over with great care till she was twelve years old .
18 Soon after that , while Letiko was away one day gathering herbs , the Sunball came to her , and said : ` Letiko , when you go home , tell your mother that she must bethink herself of what she promised me . '
19 Then Letiko went straight home , and said to her mother : ` While I was gathering herbs a fine tall gentleman came to me and charged me to tell you that you should remember what you promised him . '
20 When the woman heard that she was sore afraid , and immediately shut all the doors and windows of the house , stopped up all the chinks and holes , and kept Letiko hidden away , that the Sunball should not come and take her away .
21 But she forgot to close up the keyhole , and through it the Sunball sent a ray into the XXXXX , which took hold of the little girl and carried her away to him .	house		Order|bear|father|holes|home|house|kingdom|mother|thoughts|times

1 Johnny Chuck looked up to see a dog almost upon her .
2 Johnny 's first thought was to run to the old stone wall .
3 He was nearer to it than Polly was .
4 Then he saw that that dreadful dog would catch Polly before she could reach the stone wall .
5 A great rage filled Johnny 's heart , just as it had when he had fought the old gray Chuck .
6 Every hair stood on end , not with fear , but with anger , and he sprang in front of Polly .
7 `` Run , Polly , run ! ''
8 he cried , and Polly ran .
9 But Johnny did n't run .
10 Oh , my , no !
11 Johnny did n't run .
12 He drew himself together ready to spring .
13 He showed all his sharp teeth and ground them savagely .
14 Little sparks of fire seemed to snap out of his eyes .
15 There was no sign of fear in Johnny Chuck then , not the least little bit .
16 Just in front of him the dog stopped and barked .
17 He was a little dog , a young and foolish dog , and he was terribly excited .
18 He barked until he almost lost his breath .
19 He did n't like the looks of Johnny Chuck 's sharp teeth .
20 So he circled around Johnny , trying to get behind him .
21 But Johnny turned as the dog circled , and always the little dog found those sharp teeth directly in XXXXX of him .	front		Run|breath|dog|eyes|front|heart|rage|spring|teeth|thought
